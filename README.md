A mixed opinion dynamics and innovation diffusion simulation model for exploring the "best game no one played" phenomenon.

## Overview

The BCAT (Bounded Confidence + Adoption Threshold) model integrates a bounded confidence-based opinion dynamics model with an adoption threshold innovation diffusion model. It simulates opinion exchanges and product acceptance behaviors across four types of theoretical social networks:

- **Regular Lattice (CA)**: Toroidal 2D cellular automata with Moore neighborhood (rewiring probability = 0)
- **Small-World Network (SWN)**: Watts-Strogatz model (0 < rewiring probability < 1)
- **Random Network (RN)**: Fully rewired network (rewiring probability = 1)
- **Scale-Free Network (SFN)**: Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model

Each simulation consists of 400 agents connected by approximately 1,600 edges, with an average of 8 neighbors per agent.

## Features

- **Mixed model** — Integrates bounded confidence opinion dynamics with adoption threshold innovation diffusion in a single simulation.
- **Four network topologies** — Regular Lattice (CA), Small-World (SWN), Random (RN), and Scale-Free (SFN) networks.
- **Interactive GUI** — Tkinter-based interface with real-time visualization of attitude trajectories, social networks, adoption dynamics, and distributions.
- **Batch experiments** — Run multiple repetitions with automatic result aggregation.
- **Reproducible scenarios** — Pre-configured parameter files for reproducing all key paper figures.
- **Dual implementation** — Both Python 3 (with GUI) and NetLogo 4.0.5 versions producing statistically equivalent results.

- **Right panel**: Real-time visualization plots (4 rows, all titles in blue bold)
  - Row 1: Attitude Distribution, Threshold Distribution, Degree Distribution
  - Row 2: Attitude Trajectory with density colorbar legend (full-width, grid lines)
  - Row 3: Adoption Dynamics (adopter vs. non-adopter counts, full-width, grid lines)
  - Row 4: New Adopter Dynamics (full-width, grid lines)

## Reproducing Paper Results

Parameter configuration files for reproducing the simulation scenarios presented in the paper are provided in the `test_scenarios/` directory.

### Scenario 1: Favorable Review + Good Sales (Fig. 4)

```
python3 BCAT.py
```
Then set parameters: no-of-pioneers=5, clustered-pioneers=ON, bounded-confidence=50, convergence-rate=0.1, avg-of-attitudes=50, std-of-attitudes=10, avg-of-thresholds=20, std-of-thresholds=5, network-type=SWN/RN/CA, rewiring-probability=0.00, max-time=300. Click Setup, then Run.

### Scenario 2: Downward Compatibility -- Opinion Dynamics Only (Fig. 10)

Set: avg-of-thresholds=100, std-of-thresholds=0, no-of-pioneers=0, bounded-confidence=10, convergence-rate=0.4, avg-of-attitudes=50, std-of-attitudes=20, network-type=SWN/RN/CA, rewiring-probability=0.00, max-time=300.

### Scenario 3: Downward Compatibility -- Adoption Threshold Only (Fig. 11)

Set: avg-of-attitudes=100, std-of-attitudes=0, bounded-confidence=0, avg-of-thresholds=20, std-of-thresholds=10, no-of-pioneers=3, network-type=SWN/RN/CA, rewiring-probability=0.00, max-time=50.

## Model Algorithm

The BCAT model operates in the following phases per time step:

1. **Agent Selection**: All agents are processed in random order each tick.
2. **Neighbor Selection**: Each agent randomly selects one neighboring agent.
3. **Opinion Exchange**: If the attitude difference is below the bounded confidence threshold, attitudes are adjusted according to four scenarios based on adoption status (see Algorithm 3 in the paper).
4. **Adoption Decision**: A not-yet-adopted agent with a positive attitude (att > 50) adopts if the proportion of adopted neighbors exceeds its adoption threshold.

## Implementation Notes

- The Python version faithfully replicates the NetLogo 4.0.5 implementation, including the sequential execution semantics of NetLogo's `ask-concurrent` (which processes agents in random order with immediate effect).
- `int(v + 0.5)` is used as an equivalent to NetLogo's `round()` for positive values.
- NumPy arrays replace NetLogo's `turtles-own` for performance optimization.
- NetworkX graphs replace NetLogo's native turtle/link network structure.
- Both versions produce statistically equivalent results under identical random seeds and parameter settings.
- **Attitude Trajectory rendering optimization**: scatter points are grouped by color into 15 fixed PathCollection objects and updated incrementally via `set_offsets()`, reducing `draw_idle()` artist traversal from O(T×K) to O(1).
- **Dual-Figure architecture**: Social Network is rendered on a separate matplotlib Figure embedded in the left panel, allowing the three time-series plots (Attitude Trajectory, Adoption Dynamics, New Adopter Dynamics) to share a full-width X axis (Time) in the right panel.
- **Evaluation metrics**: FRI (Favorable Review Index = agents with attitude > 50 / total agents) and GSI (Good Sales Index = adopters / total agents) update in real time, displayed to 4 decimal places.
- **Chart legends**: Attitude Trajectory includes a 15-color density colorbar; Social Network legend shows node color meanings (adopter, attitude levels) without overlapping the graph.
- **Degree Distribution alignment**: bars are centered on integer ticks using `ax.bar()` instead of `ax.hist()` for accurate visual correspondence.
